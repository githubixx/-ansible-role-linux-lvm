# Create a volume group (VG) called "test-vg-01" which uses device "/dev/vdb"
# as physical volume:
#
# lvm_vgs:
#   - vgname: test-vg-01
#     pvs: /dev/vdb
#     state: present


# As previous example but also create a logical volume "test-lv-01"
# and allocate 10% of the available VG space.
#
# lvm_vgs:
#   - vgname: test-vg-01
#     pvs: /dev/vdb
#     state: present
#     lvm_lvs:
#       - lvname: test-lv-01
#         size: 10%VG
#         state: present

# As previous example but also create a "ext4" filesystem using logical volume
# "test-lv-01" as device for the filesystem.
#
# lvm_vgs:
#   - vgname: test-vg-01
#     pvs: /dev/vdb
#     state: present
#     lvm_lvs:
#       - lvname: test-lv-01
#         size: 10%VG
#         state: present
#         fs:
#           type: ext4
#           state: present

# As previous example but also create a directory "/mnt1" and mount the
# "ext4" filesystem there. This also creates an entry in "/etc/fstab"
# (by default).
#
# lvm_vgs:
#   - vgname: test-vg-01

#             state: mounted
#             path:
#               name: /mnt1

# As previous example but the filesystem now gets an label "mnt1". Also the
# filesystem gets mounted at "/mnt1" with the "noatime" filesystem option.
# Also the filesystem gets mounted by using the "mnt1" label mentioned above
# ("src: LABEL=mnt1"). The "owner" and "group" of the "/mnt1" directory will
# be "vagrant" and the directory permissions will be "0750".

# To be able to create filesystems additional packages are needed.
# For "ext(2|3|4)" you need "e2fsprogs" package installed e.g. So depending
# which filesystem you want to setup you may need to install additional
# package(s) or remove package(s) not needed from the list. Of course you
# can add whatever packages you want to install to the list.
#
# By default only tools needed for "ext(2|3|4)" or "xfs" are installed.
# For other filesystems you may need "btrfsprogs/btrfs-progs" or
# "dosfstools" e.g.
